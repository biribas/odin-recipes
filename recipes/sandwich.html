      <h2 class="title">Steps</h2>
      <ol id="steps">
        <li>
          Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>
          Combine ground beef, bread crumbs, egg, garlic, Parmesan cheese, parsley, 
          and Italian seasoning in a large bowl. Mix with your hands until well combined. 
          Shape mixture into 12 meatballs, and place in a baking dish.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake meatballs in the preheated oven until cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes. 
          An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 
          at least 160 degrees F (71 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>
          While the meatballs are cooking, cut baguette in half lengthwise and open 
          like a book. Remove and discard remove some of the bread from the inside 
          to make a well for the meatballs. Brush with olive oil and season with 
          garlic powder and salt. Place baguette on a baking tray, open and with 
          the oiled sides facing up.
        </li>
        <li>
          When the meatballs have 5 minutes left, slip the 
          baguette into the oven and cook until lightly toasted.
        </li>
        <li>
          Meanwhile, warm spaghetti sauce in a saucepan over medium heat.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remove meatballs from the oven. Use a slotted spoon to transfer 
          them to the hot sauce; mix gently to coat with sauce.
        </li>
        <li>
          Spoon meatballs and sauce into one side of the baguette, nestling 
          meatballs in the well. Top with slices of provolone cheese.
        </li>
        <li>
          Return to the oven until cheese is melted, 2 to 3 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cool slightly, then cut into 4 sandwiches.
        </li>
